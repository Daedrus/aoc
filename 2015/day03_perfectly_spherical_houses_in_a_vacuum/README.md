I was surprised to see that the `chunks()` method was part of IterTools and
wasn't in the standard library. As hinted [here](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-itertools-is-not-part-of-std/76016/10)
this is probably a part of a larger discussion about what makes it into the
standard library and what doesn't. It would be interesting to know how often
things get added to the standard library.
