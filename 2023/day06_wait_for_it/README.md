Once again, I really dislike this type of problem where it's all about the math
and less about the programming. A good way to recap some stuff on quadratic
equations I guess.

Programming wise, I went for primitive data types large enough to fit the
inputs and the subsequent calculations: `u64` and `f64`. I also learned that a
good way to test if an `f64` is an integer is by using the `fract()` method.
