I guess it would have turned out nicer had I used a HashMap instead of the
outer Vec but I am too lazy to refactor and this doesn't look that bad. Not too
happy about the back and forth conversion of Step and String but I had to do it
that way to make the parsing work for both parts.

The only thing special about this problem was the time it took me to understand
part 2, I kept reading the text over and over without getting it, it's some of
the most convoluted writing I've seen in an aoc problem.
