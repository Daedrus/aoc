Although this is brute-forced (I basically check all lines and columns and see
if they lead to a reflection) it was extremely fun to implement. I have a
feeling that it is possible to take things even further, there is something in
the `get_array_view` function which makes me think that more abstraction is
possible by leveraging the type system, but I am not sure how.
